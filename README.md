- We could expect that the average for other months not analized are going to fall in similar values than what we observed in Dec and june

# Summary: 

In general the analysis of this structure, have fulfill the requirements, showing that the average temperature is sufficient for the business and the volatile is not sufficient to put the proyect at risk.

The analysis could be performed in a better way in several aspects. Considering just one year in the analysis could not be sufficient.
